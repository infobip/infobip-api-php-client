### Changed

#### Dependencies

#### Model changes
* Migration to the new SMS v3 API. Check the [README.md][readme] for updated examples.
  * Introduced the new [SmsMessage](Infobip/Model/SmsMessage.php) class to replace `SmsTextualMessage` and `SmsBinaryMessage`, providing a unified structure for SMS messaging.
  * Added a content field within `SmsMessage` to define the message content.
    This supports both textual and binary messages, which can be created using [SmsTextContent](Infobip/Model/SmsTextContent.php) or [SmsBinaryContent](Infobip/Model/SmsBinaryContent.php), respectively.
  * Unified request classes by replacing `SmsAdvancedTextualRequest` and `SmsAdvancedBinaryRequest` with the new [SmsRequest](Infobip/Model/SmsRequest.php) class.
  * Consolidated sending functions: use `sendSmsMessages` instead of the `sendSmsMessage` and `sendBinarySmsMessage` functions. 
* Across all Call models, the `applicationId` field has been removed and replaced with the `platform` field, as encapsulates platform fields and reflects the current state of the endpoint.
  In addition to that, a new required `callsConfigurationId` field has been added.
* Removed delivery time window configuration classes (`SmsDeliveryTimeWindow`, `MmsDeliveryTimeWindow`, `ViberDeliveryTimeWindow`, `CallRoutingAllowedTimeWindow`, `CallsDeliveryTimeWindow`, `SmsDeliveryTimeWindow`, `CallsTimeWindow`) in favor of a unified class: [DeliveryTimeWindow](Infobip/Model/DeliveryTimeWindow.php)

* Removed URL options configuration classes (`MessagesApiUrlOptions`, `ViberUrlOptions`, `WhatsAppUrlOptions`) in favor of a unified class: [UrlOptions](Infobip/Model/UrlOptions.php)
* Removed CPaaS X platform configuration classes (`ViberPlatform`, `MessagesApiPlatform`) in favor of a unified class: [Platform](Infobip/Model/Platform.php)
* Removed delivery day enumeration classes (`SmsDeliveryDay`, `MmsDeliveryDay`, `CallsDeliveryDay`, `CallRoutingAllowedDay`) in favor of a unified class: [DeliveryDay](Infobip/Model/DeliveryDay.php)
* Removed validity period configuration classes (`ViberValidityPeriod`, `MessagesApiValidityPeriod`) in favor of a unified class: [ValidityPeriod](Infobip/Model/ValidityPeriod.php)
* Removed validity period time unit enumeration classes (`ViberValidityPeriodTimeUnit`, `MessagesApiValidityPeriodTimeUnit`) in favor of a unified class: [ValidityPeriodTimeUnit](Infobip/Model/ValidityPeriodTimeUnit.php)
