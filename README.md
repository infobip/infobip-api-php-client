## General Info
For `infobip-api-php-client` versioning we use [Semantic Versioning][semver] scheme.

Published under [MIT License][license].

The library requires PHP version >= 8.3.

## Installation

#### Using Composer
To start using the library add it as dependency in your `composer.json` file like shown below.
```json
"require": {
	"infobip/infobip-api-php-client": "6.0.0"
}
```
And simply run `composer install` to download dependencies.

#### Without Composer
If your setup prevents you from using `composer` you can manually download this package and all of its dependencies and reference them from your code. However, there are solutions that can automate this process.
One of them is `php-download` online tool. You can use it to find pre-composed [infobip client package](https://php-download.com/package/infobip/infobip-api-php-client), download it from there and use in your project without manually collecting the dependencies.

## Quickstart

#### Initialize the Configuration & HTTP client
The library supports the [API Key Header](https://www.infobip.com/docs/essentials/api-authentication#api-key-header) authentication method.
Once you have an [Infobip account](https://www.infobip.com/signup), you can manage your API keys through the Infobip [API key management](https://portal.infobip.com/settings/accounts/api-keys) page.

To see your base URL, log in to the [Infobip API Resource][apidocs] hub with your Infobip credentials or visit your [Infobip account](https://portal.infobip.com/homepage/).

```php
    use Infobip\Configuration;

    $configuration = new Configuration(
        host: 'your-base-url',
        apiKey: 'your-api-key'
    );
```

#### Send an SMS
See below, a simple example of sending a single SMS message to a single recipient.

```php
        use Infobip\ApiException;
        use Infobip\Model\SmsRequest;
        use Infobip\Model\SmsDestination;
        use Infobip\Model\SmsMessage;
        use Infobip\Api\SmsApi;
        use Infobip\Model\SmsTextContent;

        $sendSmsApi = new SmsApi(config: $configuration);

        $message = new SmsMessage(
            destinations: [
                new SmsDestination(
                    to: '41793026727'
                )
            ],
            content: new SmsTextContent(
                text: 'This is a dummy SMS message sent using infobip-api-php-client.'
            ),
            sender: 'InfoSMS'
        );

        $request = new SmsRequest(messages: [$message]);

        try {
            $smsResponse = $sendSmsApi->sendSmsMessages($request);
        } catch (ApiException $apiException) {
            // HANDLE THE EXCEPTION
        }
```

Fields provided within `ApiException` object are `code` referring to the HTTP Code response, as well as the `responseHeaders` and `responseBody`.
Also, you can get the deserialized response body using `getResponseObject` method.

```php
    $apiException->getCode();
    $apiException->getResponseHeaders();
    $apiException->getResponseBody();
    $apiException->getResponseObject();
```

Additionally, you can retrieve a `bulkId` and a `messageId` from the `SmsResponse` object to use for troubleshooting or fetching a delivery report for a given message or a bulk.
Bulk ID will be received only when you send a message to more than one destination address or multiple messages in a single request.

```php
    $bulkId = $smsResponse->getBulkId();
    $messages = $smsResponse->getMessages();
    $messageId = (!empty($messages)) ? current($messages)->getMessageId() : null;
```

#### Receive SMS message delivery report
For each SMS that you send out, we can send you a message delivery report in real time.
All you need to do is specify your endpoint when sending SMS in the `webhooks.delivery.url` field of your request, or subscribe for reports by contacting our support team at support@infobip.com.
You can use data models from the library and the pre-configured `Infobip\ObjectSerializer` serializer.

Example of webhook implementation:

```php
        use Infobip\Model\SmsDeliveryResult;
        use Infobip\ObjectSerializer;

        $objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer();

        $data = \file_get_contents('php://input');

        /**
        * @var SmsDeliveryResult $deliveryResult
        */
        $deliveryResult = $objectSerializer->deserialize($data, SmsDeliveryResult::class);

        foreach ($deliveryResult->getResults() ?? [] as $report) {
            echo $report->getMessageId() . " - " . $report->getStatus()->getName() . "\n";
        }
```
If you prefer to use your own serializer, please pay attention to the supported [date format](https://www.infobip.com/docs/essentials/integration-best-practices#date-formats).

#### Fetching delivery reports
If you are for any reason unable to receive real-time delivery reports on your endpoint, you can use `messageId` or `bulkId` to fetch them.
Each request will return a batch of delivery reports - only once. See [documentation](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api/channels/sms/sms-messaging/logs-and-status-reports/get-outbound-sms-message-delivery-reports) for more details.

```php
    $deliveryReports = $sendSmsApi
        ->getOutboundSmsMessageDeliveryReports(
            bulkId: 'some-bulk-id',
            messageId: 'some-message-id',
            limit: 10
        );

    foreach ($deliveryReports->getResults() ?? [] as $report) {
        echo $report->getMessageId() . " - " . $report->getStatus()->getName() . "\n";
    }
```

#### Unicode & SMS preview
Infobip API supports Unicode characters and automatically detects encoding. Unicode and non-standard GSM characters use additional space, avoid unpleasant surprises and check how different message configurations will affect your message text, number of characters and message parts.

```php
    use Infobip\Model\SmsPreviewRequest;

    $previewResponse = $sendSmsApi
        ->previewSmsMessage(
            new SmsPreviewRequest(
                text: 'Let\'s see how many characters will remain unused in this message.'
            )
        );

    foreach ($previewResponse->getPreviews() ?? [] as $preview) {
        echo sprintf(
            'Characters remaining: %s, text preview: %s',
            $preview->getCharactersRemaining(),
            $preview->getTextPreview()
        ) . PHP_EOL;
    }
```

#### Receive incoming SMS
If you want to receive SMS messages from your subscribers we can have them delivered to you in real time. When you buy and configure a number capable of receiving SMS, specify your endpoint, as explained in [documentation](https://www.infobip.com/docs/api#channels/sms/receive-inbound-sms-messages).
e.g. `https://{yourDomain}/incoming-sms`.
Example of webhook implementation:

```php
    use Infobip\ObjectSerializer;
    use Infobip\Model\SmsInboundMessageResult;

    $objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer();

    $data = \file_get_contents('php://input');

    /**
     * @var SmsInboundMessageResult $messages
     */
    $messages = $objectSerializer->deserialize($data, SmsInboundMessageResult::class);

    foreach ($messages->getResults() ?? [] as $message) {
        echo $message-> getFrom() . " - " . $message-> getCleanText() . "\n";
    }
```
